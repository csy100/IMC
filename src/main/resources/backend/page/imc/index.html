        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>
            The development of intelligent medicine cabinet and its application in American hospitals. Intelligent medicine cabinet was introduced into American medical institutions in 1980s. As the core of distributed drug dispensing mode in wards, it accelerated the pace of pharmacy automation construction. There is also a similar intelligent medicine cabinet access machine AMM in China. AMM is a low-cost intelligent medicine cabinet access machine AMM for social public places. Patients can input directly through voice or keyboard, and the modules in AMM will receive the signal and start running. The intelligent medicine cabinet access machine can recognize the patient's voice, then analyze the symptoms and dispense medicine. If you enter through the keyboard and press the corresponding button, the AMM machine will also be equipped with the corresponding drugs to help the patient solve the slight physical discomfort.
            However, the intelligent medicine cabinet at home and abroad is only suitable for the medicine taking operation in hospitals. On this basis, aiming at the forgetful elderly patients and the busy young and middle-aged groups, based on the upgraded version of intelligent medicine cabinet of artificial intelligence, this subject realizes automatic medicine dispensing and auxiliary reminding function, which is convenient for patients to complete medicine treatment according to their doctor's advice.

        <h2>Project Introduce</h2>
        <h3>Introduction to IMC Artificial Intelligence Medicine Cabinet: </h3>
        <p>
            The function system of the artificial intelligence medicine cabinet mainly includes the login system, query system, dosing system, drug taking system and exit system. The terminal medicine cabinet is managed by the local administrator in different scenarios, for example, the hospital is distributed in each clinical ward. The terminal medicine cabinet realizes the information management of the safe storage, automatic dispensing and inventory expiration date of drugs in the ward, and can accurately track the access records of drugs.
            The intelligent medicine cabinet adopts a humanized operation interface and a face recognition login system. When a nurse or pharmacist takes or supplements medicine, the indicator light at the corresponding position will flash to prompt the operator. The administrator can set the medication reminder time to remind the user of medication through the loudspeaker.
            The artificial intelligence medicine cabinet is targeted at the elderly. Through the information processing of the elderly, it can achieve the automatic drug distribution function, so as to realize the care and care for the elderly.</p>
